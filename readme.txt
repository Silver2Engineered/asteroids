Asteroids in Assembly: Instructions
To play this twist on Asteroids, please refer to the following guidelines:
1. There is a flying, rotating UFO that accelerates until it hits an edge of the screen, during which it bounces back and begings to accelerate again. If this UFO hits the spaceship, the game is immediately over, but you may press the spacebar to restart.
2. To move the spaceship, use the four arrow keys. The spacehsip moves at a constant velocity, but if it moves offscreen, it will appear seamlessly on the opposite end of the screen.
3. Collect asteroids for points by colliding the spaceship with them. Small asteroids are worth 25 points, and larger asteroids are worth 10 points. Your score is displayed in the top right corner of the screen.
4. If you reach 1,000 points, you will win the game.
5. The game may be paused by pressing the "p" key or by pressing the "PAUSE" button on the top left of the screen with the mouse. Your score will be saved, and if you wish to resume, simply press the spacebar.
6. Once you reach 500 points, you will have a powerup. The velocity of your spaceship will souble. 
Happy playing!
